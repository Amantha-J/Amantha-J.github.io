# About Me:

  I'm a computer science student
  
  The name 'Amantha' comes from a typo I made late at night. It stood out to me as really funny.
  I use it online a lot because its rarely taken and is uique and short.

## Intrests:

Video Games-\
I like playing video games in my free time, I tend to stay twords indie things because I think they're pushing the artform more then AAA studios. Some of my favorte games are Hollow Knignt, Celeste, Unbeatable, and ULTRAKILL.

Reading/Writing-\
My friend recommended 'The Locked Tomb' to me and I've been having a blast with it, on top of that I've really taken to creative writing as a stress relief tool. 

## Fun Things:
I love random websites so much you have no idea. Here are some of my current favorites.

[Orb Farm](https://orb.farm/)\
Make a little Aquarium and then watch it thrive or die depending on how well you set it up it, very fun little idle project.

[Draw a Horse](https://gradient.horse/)\
Draw a horse and watch it run. **DO IT**

I'm not comfortable putting a picture of my face on the internet with my name attached on a public page. So here is a screenshot from my hard drive to demonstrate that I can.\
This is from Signalis(2022) btw, very good game. Highly reccomend if you can take some tragedy and horror.\
I've been running Linux on my laptop since the virtual machine online class last semester and I like it more then Windows.
