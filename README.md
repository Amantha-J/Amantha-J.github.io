# About Me:

  I'm a computer science student
  
  The name 'Amantha' comes from a typo I made late at night. It stood out to me as really funny.
  I use it online a lot because its rarely taken and is uique and short.

## Intrests:

Video Games-\
I like playing video games in my free time, I tend to stay twords indie things because I think they're pushing the artform more then AAA studios. 

Reading/Writing-\
My friend recommended the locked tomb to me and I've been having a blast with it, on top of that I've really taken to creative writing as a stress relief tool. 

## Fun Things:
I love random websites so much you have no idea\

[Orb Farm](https://orb.farm/)\
Make a little Aquarium and then watch it thrive or die depending on how well you treat it, very fun little idle project.

[Draw a Horse](https://gradient.horse/)
Draw a horse and watch it run. **DO IT**

## Other Things:

I'm not comfortable putting a picture of my face on the internet with my name attached on a public page. So here is a screenshot from my hard drive to show I know how.\
This is from Signalis(2022) btw, very good game. Highly reccomend if you can take some tragedy and horror.
